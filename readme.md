# AnyWho is a privacy-focused dating site for adults

This repository aims to develop the code behind AnyWho into it's own open source, white-labeled framework that can be re-used by others. Currently the code and site (AnyWho.club) are in an Alpha-release. With this, the code is not yet open source and white-labeling is a ways away. 

The implementation of this future-framework is currently at [AnyWho.Club](https://anywho.club). The site should be usable, though it is not yet stable and the database backing it will be recycled as development progresses. It should be used for **testing only**. 

As we migrate to [GitHub](https://github.com/christopherbugg/anywho), the features and bugs will make their way from the [About](./about.php) page into the Issues tab.
